                            Not at all! A desire to learn and a passion for tech can suffice. Many companies and organisations offer apprenticeships and programs that value diverse backgrounds and experiences over qualifications.

                            It depends! University isn’t for everyone, and what we mean by that is everyone learns in a different way. Alternatives include Degree Apprenticeships, combining practical and academic experience while earning, and Boot Camps, which offer fast-paced, intensive training.

                            Not Really! The technology industry is broad, complex and diverse, comparable to any other industry. Skills such as problem-solving, agile thinking, and problem analysis are universally applicable. Additionally, experience and insights gained from various industries and areas of interest provide valuable perspectives which are highly valued by prospective employers.

                        <p>
                            Nope! Artificial intelligence (AI) represents an ever-evolving body of knowledge and serves as a valuable tool, but not a crutch rather than a substitute for human expertise. The presence of real people remains indispensable, while AI aids in streamlining workflows, enhancing productivity, supporting decision-making processes, and facilitating more agile working environments.

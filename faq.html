                        <p>It depends! University isn't for everyone, and what we mean by that is everyone learns in a different way and the learning environment of University may not fit, instead there are other options such as Degree Apprenticeships, where you mix practical and academic experience and earn while you learn and Boot Camps, which are fast paced intensive and hands on training.
